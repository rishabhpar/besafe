# Disaster Identification with GloVe #

This Disaster Identification model is adapted from [this entry](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/basic-eda-cleaning-and-glove) from the [Kaggle NLP With Disaster Tweets challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).
This model uses:
  * [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), an unsupervised learning algorithm for word vectorization
  * [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/)
  * [Keras](https://keras.io/)
  
 To run the model, you will need to download [GloVe's Pretrained Twitter Vector](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip) (2B tweets, 27B tokens, 1.2M vocab, uncased, 25d, 50d, 100d, & 200d vectors, 1.42 GB download) to the Disaster_Identification directory.
 
 You will also need to install Corpora and Tokenizer from NLTK. For more information about installation and the installation location, see [here](https://www.nltk.org/data.html#).
